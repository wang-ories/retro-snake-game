# Video Script: "Building a Retro Snake Game with AI in Under an Hour"

*A companion video script for the blog post*

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Structure (10-12 minutes)

### **INTRO (0:00 - 1:00)**
**[Screen: Title card with retro game aesthetic]**

**Voiceover:**
"What if I told you that you could build a complete, playable game from scratch in under an hour using AI assistance? Today, I'm going to show you exactly how I did that, creating a unique twist on the classic Snake game where apples are your enemy, not your food."

**[Screen: Quick montage of final gameplay footage]**

"I'm going to share the exact prompting techniques I discovered, show you the code that AI generated, and reveal which classic programming challenges AI handled surprisingly well - and which ones still needed human creativity."

---

### **SECTION 1: The Game Concept (1:00 - 2:30)**
**[Screen: Split screen - classic Snake vs our reverse Snake]**

**Voiceover:**
"I chose to build a reverse Snake game for several reasons. First, everyone knows the original Snake, so the twist would be immediately obvious. Second, it includes all the classic programming challenges - collision detection, game loops, state management, and UI design."

**[Screen: Gameplay footage showing apple avoidance]**

"In my version, apples kill you instantly, and you must eat other fruits - oranges, pamplemousse, and berries - to grow and score points. The game has 6 levels with increasing difficulty, and you win by completing all levels."

**[Screen: Level progression demonstration]**

"What makes this interesting is the strategic element - you're constantly navigating around danger while seeking rewards."

---

### **SECTION 2: Effective Prompting Techniques (2:30 - 4:30)**
**[Screen: Code editor showing prompts and responses]**

**Voiceover:**
"Here's what I learned about working effectively with AI on coding projects. First, be specific from the start."

**[Screen: Show ineffective vs effective prompts side by side]**

"Instead of saying 'create a snake game,' I said: 'I want something simple, the player will lose the game if the snake eat an apple. The snake must eat other fruits but not apple.' This specificity prevented back-and-forth clarifications."

**[Screen: Show clarification conversation]**

"Second, don't let AI make assumptions. When I wasn't ready to proceed, I said 'Ask a follow-up question clarifying the expected action.' This led to valuable questions about game complexity, graphics preferences, and specific features."

**[Screen: Show testing request and results]**

"Third, always request testing. When I said 'can you test this version first,' the AI created comprehensive testing strategies, including syntax validation and cross-platform compatibility checks."

---

### **SECTION 3: Classic Programming Challenges (4:30 - 7:00)**
**[Screen: Code walkthrough with syntax highlighting]**

**Voiceover:**
"Let me show you how AI handled some classic programming challenges. First, the game loop architecture."

**[Screen: Game loop code]**

"The AI automatically created a smooth 60 FPS loop with dynamic speed adjustment based on level - I didn't even ask for that feature."

**[Screen: Collision detection code]**

"For collision detection, the AI handled wall collisions, self-collisions, and fruit collisions. But here's what impressed me most - it proactively solved the 'modification during iteration' bug by creating a list copy. That's a common Python gotcha that many developers miss."

**[Screen: List iteration code comparison]**

"Instead of iterating directly over the fruits list, it created a copy to avoid runtime errors when removing items during iteration."

**[Screen: State management code]**

"For state management, the AI created clean separation of concerns with dedicated methods for each state transition. The reset_game method properly initializes all variables, and the level progression logic is robust and scalable."

---

### **SECTION 4: Development Automation (7:00 - 8:30)**
**[Screen: File structure and git commits]**

**Voiceover:**
"The time savings from automation were incredible. Instead of manually creating files, the AI generated a complete project structure - git repository, comprehensive README, requirements file, gitignore, license, and documentation folder. That saved me about 15 minutes."

**[Screen: Testing suite demonstration]**

"The comprehensive testing suite saved me about 30 minutes. The AI created tests that validate game logic without requiring pygame installation - using a clever mock framework."

**[Screen: Documentation examples]**

"Documentation generation saved me 45 minutes. The AI created detailed README files with tables, emojis, proper formatting, installation instructions for multiple platforms, and even wrote the git commit messages."

**[Screen: Error handling code]**

"Error handling and edge cases saved another 20 minutes. The AI proactively handled scenarios like preventing the snake from reversing into itself, and created robust fruit spawning that avoids collisions."

---

### **SECTION 5: Interesting AI Solutions (8:30 - 10:00)**
**[Screen: Code examples with explanations]**

**Voiceover:**
"Some of the AI-generated solutions were genuinely clever. Look at this enum usage for directions."

**[Screen: Direction enum code]**

"Instead of just storing direction names, the enum stores the actual movement vectors. This eliminates the need for separate direction-to-movement conversion logic."

**[Screen: Difficulty scaling code]**

"The dynamic difficulty scaling is sophisticated - it increases both apple count and good fruit count per level, but caps the apple count at reasonable levels using the min function."

**[Screen: Mock testing framework]**

"But the most ingenious solution was this mock pygame system for testing. The AI created fake pygame classes that implement just enough functionality to test the game logic without requiring pygame installation. This allowed comprehensive testing on any system."

---

### **SECTION 6: Final Results & Gameplay (10:00 - 11:30)**
**[Screen: Gameplay footage with UI elements highlighted]**

**Voiceover:**
"Here's the final result - a fully functional retro Snake game with 6 levels, progressive difficulty, score tracking, and victory conditions."

**[Screen: Show different levels and fruit types]**

"The visual design uses a minimal retro color palette - green snake, red deadly apples, and colorful good fruits on a black background. Each level increases the number of apples and the game speed."

**[Screen: Testing results]**

"All tests pass, confirming that collision detection, movement mechanics, growth system, and level progression work correctly."

**[Screen: Project statistics]**

"The final statistics: about 500 lines of code generated, 8 files created, 7 comprehensive test functions, and 3 documentation pages - all in under an hour."

---

### **CONCLUSION (11:30 - 12:00)**
**[Screen: Side-by-side comparison of human vs AI contributions]**

**Voiceover:**
"Here's what I learned: AI excels at implementation, boilerplate code, testing, and documentation. But human creativity is still essential for the initial concept, requirements refinement, and quality assurance."

**[Screen: Final gameplay montage]**

"The future of game development is collaborative - human creativity paired with AI implementation. With the right prompting techniques, you can go from concept to playable game faster than ever before."

**[Screen: Call to action with repository link]**

"The complete game is available on GitHub with full documentation. Try it yourself, and let me know what games you build with AI assistance!"
