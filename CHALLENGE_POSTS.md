🐍 I Built a Deadly Snake Game in Under 1 Hour with AI! | #BuildGamesChallenge

In this video, I show you exactly how I used #AmazonQDevCLI to build a unique retro Snake game where apples are deadly and you must avoid them!

🎮 GAME FEATURES:
• Reverse Snake mechanics (apples = instant death!)
• 4 fruit types: deadly apples, safe oranges, pamplemousse, berries
• 6 progressive levels with increasing difficulty
• Retro pixel art style with minimal colors
• Complete victory condition (beat all levels to win!)

⚡ WHAT AI AUTOMATED:
• Complete game implementation (500+ lines)
• Comprehensive testing framework
• Cross-platform installation script
• Professional documentation
• Project structure and git management

🔧 PROMPTING TECHNIQUES REVEALED:
• How to write specific requirements that get better results
• When to ask AI for clarification vs letting it assume
• Requesting testing and validation automatically
• Getting complete project structure, not just code

📊 FINAL STATS:
• Development time: Under 1 hour
• Files created: 11 (including docs, tests, blog post)
• Lines of code: 500+
• Test coverage: 7 comprehensive test functions

🔗 PLAY THE GAME: https://github.com/wang-ories/retro-snake-game
📝 FULL BLOG POST: Detailed tutorial with all prompting techniques
🧪 TESTING SUITE: Validates game logic without pygame dependency

The combination of human creativity and AI implementation is incredibly powerful. This project proves you can go from concept to playable game faster than ever before!

🎮 Just completed the #BuildGamesChallenge using #AmazonQDevCLI - and the results exceeded my expectations!

I built a retro Snake game with a unique twist: apples are deadly, and players must avoid them while collecting other fruits. What started as a simple game concept became a comprehensive development case study.

🚀 **Key Achievements:**
• Complete game built in under 1 hour
• 500+ lines of production-ready code
• Comprehensive testing suite (7 test functions)
• Professional documentation and project structure
• Cross-platform compatibility handled automatically

💡 **What This Means for Software Development:**
The AI didn't just write code - it handled the entire development lifecycle:
✅ Architecture and design patterns
✅ Error handling and edge cases
✅ Testing frameworks and validation
✅ Documentation and project management
✅ Cross-platform deployment considerations

🎯 **Business Implications:**
• Faster prototyping and MVP development
• Reduced time-to-market for simple applications
• More time for creative problem-solving and strategy
• Lower barrier to entry for technical implementation

The future of software development is collaborative: human creativity and strategic thinking paired with AI implementation and automation.
